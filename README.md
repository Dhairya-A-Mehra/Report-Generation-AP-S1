Let’s start by taking a look at your project’s structure and key components to draft a suitable README file. I’ll examine the contents of your uploaded ZIP file to understand what this project does, and then we can outline a README for it.

The project appears to be a full-stack web application with the following structure:

Frontend (client): Built with React, including components like AdminReportsTable, CreateReport, EditReport, and pages like Home, Login, and Volunteer.
Backend (server): Uses Node.js with routes for admin and volunteer functionalities and connects to a database using the configuration in db.js.
Database Scripts: SQL files for table creation and data insertion in the database folder, suggesting it relies on a relational database.
